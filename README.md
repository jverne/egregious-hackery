# Egregious Hackery!
This is a remote repository for egregious hackery with Git where I try out different things while taking some Git courses.

This is a completely _useless_ and unnecessary repository. You **shouldn't** be reading this.

Why are you still here? Go home.

## Notes
- There is nothing to see here
- Move along
- Fnord
